        <p>At Cogmaze Publishing, we aim to encourage children to embrace their unique differences and
            celebrate their gifts. We aim to create a culture of inclusivity knowing that everyone is
            Special in their own way.
        </p>
        <p>We love bringing stories to life through our characters and we are always writing a story about
            something! We aim to engage children through our colourful picture books! We enjoy speaking to
            parents and learning from experts, as we are passionate about helping children to achieve their
            full potential.

        </p>
        <p>More about us:
        </p>
        <p>Anna and Julie instantly became friends when they first met through their books and have been friends ever
            since. Both sharing the same vision, values and goals, they decided to team up to create Cogmaze Publishing,
            a place where you can find a range of inclusive books, resources, signposting and fun activities for the
            children too. Please
            bear with us as our site is still under construction. We will be adding more very soon...

                <bold-element>Julie Alison McDonald</bold-element>, Sussex based author and illustrator, who created the
                Binkie & Friends’ series, is dedicated to fostering a culture of inclusivity where our diverse
                differences are
                celebrated. Drawing from her personal experience, as the mother of a son with autism, Julie
                understands the challenges that neurodiversity can present, in both school and everyday life.

            </p>
            <p><italic-element>"My goal is to promote acceptance and understanding, through the characters in our books,
                    helping others to recognise and appreciate the unique strengths that each of us
                    possess.”</italic-element>

                <bold-element>Anna Emilia</bold-element> is the author of Little Cat and Friends, a series of books
                featuring Molina who is a curious cat.

            </p>
            <p><italic-element>"As a child I struggled to read and communicate, so I know first hand the difficulties
                    that children face and also the mechanisms that are put in place to hide it. Being diagnosed with
                    dyslexia as an adult was a game changer, it all made sense!”

            </p>
            <p><italic-element>"My passion is that no child is left behind. I believe it’s integral that the sooner a
                    child learns
                    to read the easier it is to communicate. Learning should be interesting and fun.”</italic-element>

        <p><bold-element>School Visits</bold-element>
        </p>
        <p>We often visit schools and nurseries, to share insights with the children on neurodiversity,
            discussing its impact on individuals and how we celebrate uniqueness. If you would like us
            to visit your school and host an event for children, please email us.
