        <p>Anna and Julie instantly became friends when they first met through their books
            and have been friends ever since. They share the same vision, values and goals.
        </p>
        <p>At Cogmaze, we aim to encourage children to embrace their unique differences
            and celebrate their gifts, knowing that they are Special in their own way. We
            aim to cultivate a culture of inclusivitiy.
        </p>
        <p>Anna and Julie are both neurodiverse, and so we know what it feels like first hand. We
            understand the challenges that children face everyday, especially at school. We
            are passionate about helping the neurodiverse community to understand themselves
            better and to learn new ways to feel at ease in an environment that often makes them
            feel uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p>We love bringing stories to life through our characters and we are always
            writing a story about something! We aim to to delight and enlighten children
            through our stories! We love speaking to parents and learning from experts, as we are
            passionate about helping children to achieve their full potential.
        </p>
        <p>The messages in our books aim to help children to become more accepting of our
            differences and broaden their horizons. We also hope that our books will teach some
            useful techniques as and, at the same time, promote kindness and empathy.
        </p>
