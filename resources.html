        <p>We offer a range of resources aimed at helping teachers and parents better understand autism and
            neurodiversity. Our popular book, Say Hello to Hedgy, has contributed to the introduction of Hedgy Club,
            a program West Sussex County Council has set up as part of the Autism for Schools Project.
        </p>

            Our new book, Oscar Finds the Treasure, is a great Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) resource. It
            teaches
            useful strategies to help children improve their communication skills. For further DLD resources please
            visit <a href="https://www.clarkslt.co.uk">clarkslt.co.uk</a>
        </p>

        <p>We regularly visit schools and nurseries, to share insights into neurodiversity, discussing its impact on
            individuals and how we celebrate uniqueness. If you would like us to visit your school and host an event for
            children,
            please email us.
